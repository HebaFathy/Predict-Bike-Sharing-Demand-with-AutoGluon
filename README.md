Bike-sharing demand is highly relevant to related problems companies encounter, such as Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash. Predicting demand not only helps businesses prepare for spikes in their services but also improves customer experience by limiting delays.

In this project, we used the AutoGluon(opens in a new tab) library to train several models for the Bike Sharing Demand(opens in a new tab) competition in Kaggle. By using Tabular Prediction(opens in a new tab) to fit data from CSV files provided by the competition. This project demonstrated the use AutoGluon to train several iterations of models and recorded optimization of the problem. We submitted several entries to the competition and achieved a rank within Kaggle.
